# YouTube Statistics EDA
A beginner personal project working with Jupyter Notebooks to explore data about YouTube videos.

Main dataset regarding YouTube video statistics taken from Kaggle user Advay Patil. Original dataset can be found [here!](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/summer-olympics-medals)

One of the first small personal projects I worked on to get some extra basic practice with Python libraries for visualization and EDA in Jupyter Notebooks!
