In order to do this, I utilized the published date of the videos, as each of the rows in this dataset represents one video. However, something to note from how I chose to do this is that this method does not necessarily visualize machine learning interest over time. Rather, it visualizes how the individual machine learning videos published at different points in time were faring in 2022, when this dataset was cultivated."
